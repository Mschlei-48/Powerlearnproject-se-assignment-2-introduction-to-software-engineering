Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: Software Engineering refers to the cdevelopment of software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
 >   - The software development life cycle includes the requirement analysis, fasibility study, system design and implementation.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.:
>    - During the feasibility study they are assessing the feasibility of the study in  technical, operational, and economic areas. During the system design phase they are designing the look and feel of the software. Then during the implementation phase they are  developing the software.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering: 
>    - The difference between these two models is that the Waterfall model has a sequentila approach, while the Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach, with no sequentila order of steps to follow. The waterfall model is not flexible in the sense that, once the steps or seqeusnce of exection have been defined, there is no changing them, while the Agile model is more flexible in the sense taht thebexecution process can be changed to adapt to changing requirements. The waterfall model is more suited for projects that have well-defined requirements and scope, while the agile model is more ideal for projects that eveolve over time as the requirements change.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle?
>    - Requiremets engineering is  a systematic process of idetifying, documenting, and managing the needs and requirements of stakeholders for a software system. It is important because it sets the foundation for all upcoming phases of the software development lifecycle, therefore ensuring the success of the projects. The process involves the following:
    1. Requirements gathering - The requirements are gathered from stakeholders.
    2. Requirements analysis - This phase is where the requirements are refined, and prioritized.
    3. Requirements speciification - The requirements are documented clearly.
    4. Requirements validation - This phase ensures that the requuirements are complete, consistent and aligned with  stakeholder needs.
    5. Requirements Management - The phase's goal is to manage changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

Software Design Principles: 

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
>    - Modularity in software design refers to the dividing of a software system into smaller units called moudules. Each module has a piece of functionality. Modularity imporves maintanability byreducing the risk of unintended side effects in other parts of the system. During scalability,different modules can be worked at at the same time allowing the system to scale more easily.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
>    1. Unit testing -  It tests individual components or units of code in isolation. It is used to validate each unit of a software.
    2. Integration testing - It tests the interactions between integrated components. It is used to identify issues that may  occur when units are combined.
    4. System testing - It tests the whole system. This is used to validate the compliance of the system with the specified requirements.
    5. Acceptance testing - This tests the readiness of the system for deployment by veryfying whether it meets the business needs and requirements.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
>    - Version control systems are systems that are  used to manage the versions of systems. 
>    - Theybare important because they allow many developers to work on the same project at the same time, track and merge changes made, and also keep a history of all changes made.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
>    - The role of a softare project manager is ensuring successful planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
>    - Their key responsibilities include project planning,team management, communication,resource management, quality assurance and documenting and reporting the projects.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
>    - Software maintenance is the process of modifying and updating software applications after their initial deployment to correct faults, improve performance, adapt to a changed environment, or enhance functionalities.
        1. Corrective Maintenance - Involves diagnosing and fixing bugs or defects in the software.
        2. Adaptive Maintenance - Modifying the software to work in a new or changed environment.
        3. Perfective Maintenance - Enhancing or improving the software to add new features or improve existing functionalities.
        4. Preventive Maintenance - Making changes to prevent future problems or to improve maintainability.
